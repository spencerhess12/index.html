    <h2>My Haiku</h2>
    <p>My Current Situation: A Haiku</p>
    <p><i>Procrastination<br>The clock runs close to midnight<br>Brought this on myself</i></p>

    <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>I love to spend time with my family. I come home from work each day to my beautiful wife and twin two year old sons. The house is always very lively and it brings me so much happiness to be a husband and father</p>
    <p>I love to learn, school is actually an enjoyable time for me. Particularly, I love the feeling of figuring something out, solving a puzzle. Which is why I think Computer Science called to me as a major.</p>
    <p>Finally, I love competition. I grew up playing soccer and basketball and any other sport I could get my hands on. Recently I discovered tennis and have wondered where it has been all my life. Can't believe I ever played pickelball.</p>
